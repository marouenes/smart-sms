# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We appreciate your effort and time.

If you are interested in contributing,you can find open issues and bugs in the issues board. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the team.

## What we're looking for

We hope that you will consider contributing to this project. You can contribute in many ways. For example, you might:

- Add documentation and “how-to” articles to the README or documentation space.

- Help people with the questions they ask on the Microsoft Teams channel.

- Create an extension that provides additional functionality.

- Improve the existing application to demonstrate features.

- Work on bugs you've found in the issues Board.

When contributing, we ask that you:

- Let us know what you plan in the ticket comments.

- Provide tests and documentation. It is very unlikely that we will accept new features or functionality without the proper testing. When fixing a bug, provide a failing test case that your patch solves.

- Open a Pull Request with your patches and we will review your contribution and respond as quickly as possible. Keep in mind that we are also working and it may take us some time to get back to you. Thanks for your patience.
